# planetplotter
C++ code for a simlation and visualization of the inner workings of a planet. Code uses several equations of state (defined in equation_of_state.cpp) to iterate mass, pressure, and density from the center of a planet outwards. Iteration is done using the Runge-Kutta method. The estimate of the central pressure of the planet uses the bisection method. Detailed explanation of the code can be found on the Final_Project_Writeup.pdf.
